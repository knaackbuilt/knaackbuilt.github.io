# {{title}}

## General Policy 
1. **The public does not have a right** to access any information about our family. That right belongs to the nuclear family until the age of consent and to the individuals themselves.
2. Being that the world is a highly connected place and we are not crazy hermits and luddites, there likely will be some information disclosed by accident, without malicious intent, or in a way that is really unpreventable to live a modern life. We are understanding and forgiving people. 
3. Consent is always required. When in doubt, ask.

## Photography/Videography/Likeness Representation
1. The members of the Knaack family retain all rights to any photos, videos, graphics or other digital or print likeness representations of anyone in the nuclear family. 
2. You may not post any photos, videos, graphics or other digital likeness representations on any platform without our consent and review. 
3. If you have been granted permission to use or distribute any media, please be aware of your privacy settings on each platform you use. For example, we request that your social media accounts be set to private if sharing media involving our family. 

## Do Not Track 
1. Basically this one is a giant middle finger to any company that thinks they have a right to consumer information about our family. We use all the legal tools at our disposal to stop you from tracking our browsing behavior, purchase history, ad-retargeting, or any other really morally dubious and shitty backdoor tool you use to send us more “accurate” advertising. Just have a better product and you won’t need to sell it so hard. 
2. If there is an opportunity to revoke your ability to track any of our digital behaviors all members of the Knaack family hereby and in perpetuity revoke consent to track us for any reason.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Personal Health Information (PHI)
1. Under no circumstances are PII or PHI to be disclosed on any publicly accessible platform without consent.
2. The definition of PII we are using is at [https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII)
3. The definition of PHI we are using is at [https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/index.html)
4. Why do I even have to include this section? Just in case anyone gets the bright idea to make a poster of this shit and send it to us as a gift. 


## Why are you doing this?
**The internet is a dangerous place.** It’s riddled with security vulnerabilities and lots of shitty people. Most folks don’t have any idea what they agree to when the sign up for a service, link it to their google account, share their camera permissions, and sync their devices to it all while using the same username and password they have for their bank accounts. 

Do you really think that the company that made your $19.99 toaster spent a lot of money on the security for the smart-app for it? Hell I don’t trust Amazon devices to be on the same subnet as my home network and they spend literally billions of dollars on securing their platform.
